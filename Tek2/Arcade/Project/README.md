Arcade is a project who consit to recreate an arcade computer.
There must be possible to switch between graphic and game library during runtime.

## Before continuing...

This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way! Nothing to see here... The groups don't want to be involved to your -42.
If you're not, no worries! You're welcome here!

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need G++ Compiler. And SDL2_ttf-devel.

### Building program

Start the programm with ./arcade <pathToTheGraphicLib>

Be carreful, only valid graphic librairies will be take in consideration by the program.

For much more informations, please refere to the /doc directory.

### Coding Style

Arcade is developed with C++. EPITECH doesn't impose any Coding Style to this but I tried to be as cleaner as possible.
