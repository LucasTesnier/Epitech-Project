Arcade is a project who consit to recreate an arcade computer. There must be possible to switch between graphic and game library during runtime.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Before continuing...}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way! Nothing to see here... The groups don\textquotesingle{}t want to be involved to your -\/42. If you\textquotesingle{}re not, no worries! You\textquotesingle{}re welcome here!\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Prerequisites}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
To use this project, you\textquotesingle{}ll need G++ Compiler. And SDL2\+\_\+ttf-\/devel.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Building program}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
Start the programm with ./arcade $<$path\+To\+The\+Graphic\+Lib$>$

Be carreful, only valid graphic librairies will be take in consideration by the program.

Arcade is developed with C++. EPITECH doesn\textquotesingle{}t impose any Coding Style to this but I tried to be as cleaner as possible.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Authors}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
